Made in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° by [maragu](https://www.maragu.dk/), maker of [online Go courses](https://www.golang.dk/).

## Features

- Simple logger with just a single method, `Event`, which logs named events with a given sample rate.
- Sane defaults log to STD_ERR and include event name, sample rate, time, and build info. More to come.
- No external dependencies.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"maragu.dev/snorkel"
)

func main() {
	log := snorkel.New(snorkel.Options{})

	// Log an event with the name "Yo", sample rate 1, and env=sparkly
	log.Event("Yo", 1, "env", "sparkly")
}
```
